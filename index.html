            <b>10<sup>th</sup> June 2019,</b><br><br> The day marked, from which I am starting my career. The first experience is the experience
            as an intern. When we talk about internship there are a lot of ideas that comes up to the mind and that makes us 
            anxious and nervous. For me, I was nervous plus excited together. The time for the internship is 9 hours, yes 9 fucking 
            hours. I couldn't even get focused on 2 hours class and its 9 fucking hours.<br>
            But, I came with hell lot of energy and open mind which is open to learning. These 3 months is going to be the time to
            experience shift in energy, mindset, perception and the way to career and the lifestyle I want for next 80 years I live.
            <br>
            I always wanted to create an impact. Why not create an impact by making the life of people easier through internet?
            Why not making their life luxirous? This question is striking my mind at the moment.<br><br><br>
